# ðŸ’° Treasury

### Understanding Treasuries
We're using a custodial solution, with seedless wallets leveraging MPC cryptography to provide maximum security. This layer allows you to store, and manage, your DAO funds across approximately 25 blockchains.
Using this solution, your DAO will require a certain number of core members to sign off on any funds transfer. 
### What is the process of adding asset?
Using the dashboard, you should pick the blockchain you want to transfer assets. Then, your DAO treasury will be created, and for a given address, you can send funds.
### What are assets you support?
We support more than 9,000 assets across approximately 25 blockchain networks
